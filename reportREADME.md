# machine-learning-challenge Report
I created 3 models to test
Model 01: Was created using a grid search and cross validation method. This model gave a 88% accuracy
Model 02: Was created using a KNN method. Optimized for k and got a value of 7. This model gave a 84% accuracy
Model 03: Was created using a neural network method. I created 20 nodes  This model gave a 89% accuracy
Created a model file using model 01. I think this will build a robust model to identify exoplanets.
